What it is:
-	The EducationSystemTree Class: This class is the core of the program. It uses a tree data structure to model the education system, with levels like “National Education System,” “Primary Education,” “Secondary Education,” etc.

What it can do:
-	Is to  build the Tree: The  systemTree()  method constructs the education system tree by creating nodes and linking them together hierarchically. And it can display the Tree: The  displayTree()  method traverses the tree and prints its structure, including the name of each node and its role (root, parent, child, or leaf).

Why did you make that kind of application:
-	 Because creating this application it can allow to experiment with different ways to implement and visualize tree structures. And it can take the basic educational tree code and expand it in many ways to make it more interactive, visually appealing, or even more advanced.  

How it contributes to us or the community:
-	It can contribute Educational Value that provides a practical example of a tree data structure, which can be helpful for learning and understanding this important programming concept. And  Potential for Further Development that can be used as a foundation for building more sophisticated applications that could benefit.
